## 1. Introduction: What We Mean by "Emerging"

This module is about emerging technologies. But what does that mean? Is it Generative AI? Virtual Reality? A library's first TikTok account?

The truth is, **"emerging" is a moving target**. What is "emerging" for one institution might be outdated for another.

The key concept is that technology doesn't emerge in a vacuum. It's a "confluence of advances", where multiple advancements (like faster networks, smartphones, streaming media, and AI) converge to create a broader impact.

This module will not focus on specific apps that could be gone next year. Instead, we will focus on **durable frameworks** for understanding, evaluating, and adapting to *any* new technology that comes your way.

## 2. Core Framework 1: The 5 Characteristics of Information Communities

We will use Fisher and Fulton's (2022) five characteristics of information communities to shift our focus from "what is this new gadget?" to "what does this new technology do for our communities?". This provides a theoretical framework that will outlast any specific app.
