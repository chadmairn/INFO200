    <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction: What We Mean by "Emerging"</h2>
    <p>This module is about emerging technologies. But what does that mean? Is it Generative AI? Virtual Reality? A library's first TikTok or Instagram account? The truth is, 'emerging' is a moving target.</p>
    <p>The key concept here is that technology doesn't emerge in a vacuum. It's a "confluence of advances", where multiple advancements (like faster networks, smartphones, streaming media, and AI) converge to create a broader impact.</p>
    <p>This module will not focus on specific apps or products that could be gone next year. Instead, we will focus on <strong>durable frameworks</strong> for understanding, evaluating, and adapting to <em>any</em> new technology that comes your way. Also, it is important to remember that what is "emerging" for one institution might be outdated for another.</p>

    <h2 id="framework1">2. Core Framework 1: The 5 Characteristics of Information Communities</h2>
    <p>We will use Fisher and Fulton's (2022) five characteristics of information communities to shift our focus from "what is this new gadget?" to "what does this new technology do for our communities?". This provides a theoretical framework that will outlast any specific app or platform.</p>
    <p><strong>Click each characteristic to learn more:</strong></p>

    <details>
        <summary><b>1. Emphasis on Collaboration Among Diverse Information Providers</b></summary>
        <p>This characteristic highlights that collaboration is essential for gathering and distributing diverse information. Emerging technology acts as the "connective tissue".</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Examples:</b> Cloud-based platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Discord have created the foundation for modern collaboration, allowing people to work together without being in the same building or even the same time zone.</li>
            <li><b>Technical Example:</b> An Application Programming Interface (API) allows organizations to share data without sharing their systems. A museum's digital archive API could let a public library's website pull in relevant images for a local history project, creating a seamless user experience.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><b>2. Capacity to Form Around People's Needs to Access and Use Information</b></summary>
        <p>Communities now form organically where the need is. They don't wait for an institution; they form a Facebook Group, Discord server, or Subreddit to solve a problem, share information, or advocate for a cause.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Example:</b> Platforms like Nextdoor are information communities that form exclusively around a shared geographic need. The technology allows people to self-organize and share information at the neighborhood level.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><b>3. Capacity to Exploit the Information-Sharing Qualities of Emerging Technologies</b></summary>
        <p>This is the core of this module. It's not just about sharing text; it's about sharing experiences, generating new content, and automating processes.</p>
        
        <h4><b>Exploiting the INTELLIGENT Web (AI)</b></h4>
        <p>We can now generate information, not just retrieve it. We can ask an AI to summarize a complex document, explain a concept in simple terms, automate tasks, or draft code.</p>
        
        <img src="ai-pros-cons.png" alt="Pros and Cons of AI in information sharing" class="img-placeholder" style="max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">(Replace "ai-pros-cons.png" with your image file name)</p>

        <h4><b>Exploiting the IMMERSIVE Web (VR/AR)</b></h4>
        <p>We can now share experiences. A library or museum can offer a Virtual Reality (VR) tour of a historical site, allowing a user to "be there". This technology fosters "social presence". An author talk in a VR social space allows attendees from around the world to feel like they are in the same room.</p>
        
        <img src="immersive-web.png" alt="Pros and Cons of the Immersive Web" class="img-placeholder" style="max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">(Replace "immersive-web.png" with your image file name)</p>

        <h4><b>Exploiting the PARTICIPATORY Web (Social Platforms)</b></h4>
        <p>Information-sharing is no longer linear. Platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels allow a single, compelling "how-to" video from a librarian to reach millions. We exploit this by inviting the community to share with us, such as asking for local stories or creating a "digital commons" where users upload and tag their own historical photos.</p>

        <img src="participatory-web.png" alt="The Power of the Participatory Web" class="img-placeholder" style="max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">(Replace "participatory-web.png" with your image file name)</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><b>4. Ability to Transcend Barriers to Information Sharing</b></summary>
        <p>This is about access and equity. Technology can be a powerful force for breaking down walls that have traditionally firewalled information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Language Barriers:</b> AI-powered translation can translate text, audio, and even live conversation in real-time, opening up global information. AI can also simplify complex text (like legal or medical jargon) into plain language.</li>
            <li><b>Accessibility Barriers:</b> Technology is a game-changer for users with disabilities. AI-powered computer vision can describe images for the visually impaired, and advanced speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and voice control are now standard.</li>
            <li><b>Cost & Format Barriers:</b> Open Access (OA) and Open Educational Resources (OER) help eliminate paywalls. Projects like the Internet Archive provide access to rare items to anyone with an internet connection.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><b>5. Capacity to Foster Social Connectedness</b></summary>
        <p>This final point links directly to the "community" aspect. Technology is not just an information-delivery tool; it provides human-connection.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Examples:</b> Platforms like Discord and Reddit foster a sense of belonging around a shared interest. Connections are built on shared experience, like a virtual book club on Zoom or a collaborative playlist.</li>
            <li><b>The Ultimate Example:</b> Social VR platforms are built to trick your brain into feeling like you are physically present with others, creating a much stronger emotional and social bond.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, "emerging technologies" are the powerful enabler that allows a modern information community to collaborate, form, share, transcend barriers, and connect.</p>

    <h2 id="framework2">3. Core Framework 2: "Continuous Computing"</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <h4>Key Concept: Continuous Computing</h4>
        <p>Over 15 years ago, analyst Wade Roush (2005) coined this term to capture our modern life.</p>
        <p>It describes the cultural shift from <strong>using the internet at a desk</strong> to <strong>living within an information stream</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is the "anytime, anywhere" access enabled by mobile devices, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks. This framework is the foundation for everything else—it explains the rise of social media and the 24/7 nature of our information communities.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">(Replace "continuous-computing.png" with your image file name)</p>

    <h2 id="analysis">4. Analysis: The Three Broad Shifts to Watch</h2>
    <p>Rather than listing gadgets, let's look at three broad, durable shifts in how technology works. These categories will be relevant for many years.</p>
    <p><strong>Click each shift to explore and reflect:</strong></p>

    <details>
        <summary><b>Shift 1: The Participatory Web (Social & Collaborative)</b></summary>
        <p>This is the concept that the web is no longer a "read-only" medium. It's a "read-write" platform for co-creation. This includes everything from social media and community forums to wikis and collaborative documents.</p>
        <p><b>🤔 Ask yourself:</b> <i>"How do our communities use these platforms to form, self-organize, and share their own narratives?"</i></p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><b>Shift 2: The Intelligent Web (AI & Personalization)</b></summary>
        <p>In this shift, the web is moving from retrieving information to generating and anticipating it. This covers generative AI, machine learning, and the algorithms that personalize your feeds.</p>
        <p><b>🤔 Ask yourself:</b> <i>"How does this change information-seeking?" and "What are the new challenges of authority, bias, and digital literacy?"</i></p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><b>Shift 3: The Immersive Web (AR, VR & Blended Reality)</b></summary>
        <p>Visualize the web as "breaking free" from the 2D screen.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Augmented Reality (AR)</b> overlays digital information onto the physical world (e.g., phone filters, navigation).</li>
            <li><b>Virtual Reality (VR)</b> creates fully digital environments for new forms of learning, presence, and connection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>🤔 Ask yourself:</b> <i>"How can this offer new ways to experience information, history, and community events?"</i></p>
    </details>

    <h2 id="case-study">5. Case Study: The Great Accelerator (Lessons from the Pandemic)</h2>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic wasn't just a crisis: it was a sudden, massive-scale experiment in emerging technology.</p>
    <p>The pandemic didn't invent new trends; it <strong>massively accelerated</strong> ones that were already here, like remote work, digital-first services, and video conferencing. Organizations had to pivot overnight.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h4>The Human Impact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Truth 1:</strong> Technology became the primary way to <strong>maintain human connection</strong>, not just deliver content.</li>
            <li><strong>Truth 2:</strong> It exposed the <strong>deep digital divides</strong> in our communities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A "continuous computing" world is impossible if you don't have access or skills. This is another vital role of information professionals.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="toolkit">6. Toolkit: How to "Watch the Horizon"</h2>
    <p>You cannot be an expert in every new app. However, as an information professional, you must be an expert in <strong>environmental scanning</strong>—knowing how to "watch the horizon" for what's next.</p>
    <p>Here are two key resources to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Tool 1: Pew Research (Internet & Technology)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Link:</b> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/internet-technology/" target="_blank">https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/internet-technology/</a></li>
        <li><b>What It Is:</b> High-quality, non-partisan data on how Americans are using technology and the internet.</li>
        <li><b>How to Use It:</b> Pew is the <strong>"WHAT IS."</strong> Use it to understand your community and their behaviors *right now*.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tool 2: The Horizon Report</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Link:</b> <a href="https://library.educause.edu/resources/2021/2/horizon-reports" target="_blank">https://library.educause.edu/resources/2021/2/horizon-reports</a></li>
        <li><b>What It Is:</b> A strategic report from Educause that analyzes technologies and trends expected to impact higher education and libraries.</li>
        <li><b>How to Use It:</b> The Horizon Report is the <strong>"WHAT'S NEXT."</strong> Use it to think strategically about the future and anticipate change before it arrives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="conclusion">7. Conclusion: Mindset > Technology</h2>
    <p>Ultimately, the most important "emerging technology" is <strong>your own professional mindset</strong>.</p>
    <p>Your role will evolve. Remember: we are not tech experts; <strong>we are community experts who leverage technology</strong> to meet our community's needs.</p>

    <img src="mindset-vs-tech.png" alt="Diagram showing Mindset is more important than Technology" class="img-placeholder" style="max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">
    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">(Replace "mindset-vs-tech.png" with your image file name)</p>

    <h2 id="action">8. Your Call to Action</h2>
    <p>Here is an interactive checklist to get you started:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
